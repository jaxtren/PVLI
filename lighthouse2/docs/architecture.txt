0. Application:
   Implements run-time functionality
   Interface to user
   Spawns the RenderSystem
   Selects a core for the RenderSystem
------------------------------------
1. Platform:
   Owns window
   Only platform-dependent layer
   Currently uses GLFW for OpenGL access
   Assumes OpenGL as the underlying API

2. RenderSystem:
   Owns primary copy of scene data
   Handles scene data import
   Handles scene data maintenance
   Owns one core, as selected by application
   Provides core with scene data
   Tunnels core statistics to application
   Tunnels render requests to core
   
3. RenderCore:
   Owns a render device
   Implements the rendering algorithm
